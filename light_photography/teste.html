<p>"Sofia is a professional photographer and we were extremely impressed with her reliability and creativity of her work. She photographed my daughter's baptism and did an amazing job. Her attention to detail and her having an 'eye' for great photos was definitely evident. We were really happy with our pictures and it is a way for our daughter to look back on the day and see who was there and what happened. The pictures are priceless! We would definitely recommend Sofia and use her for future events. Thanks you so much Sofia!"</p>

<p>"Light photography photographed all elements of my wedding in November and April 2014! I actually found light photography online and took a chance on using them and trusted fate and behold I got some of the best photographs of my life,with real genuine care given in every single photo.

"We’ve been searching for a local photographer who can produce quality photographs that capture memorable moments, and Sofia’s it. Since photographing a couple of our personal events, we’ve hired her for numerous corporate parties and we’d definitely recommend Sofia for anyone looking to have a well-photographed event. Not only does she produce quality and stunning photographs, but her mannerism and professionalism pre, during, and post the event is outstanding. She’s able to produce photos in days, and sometimes, hours, after the event. Overall, it’s great working with her. Highly recommended!"</p>
