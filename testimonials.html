<h2>Carita Valentini - April 9th, 2014</h2>
<p>"Sofia is a professional photographer and we were extremely impressed with her reliability and creativity of her work. She photographed my daughter's baptism and did an amazing job. Her attention to detail and her having an 'eye' for great photos was definitely evident. We were really happy with our pictures and it is a way for our daughter to look back on the day and see who was there and what happened. The pictures are priceless! We would definitely recommend Sofia and use her for future events. Thanks you so much Sofia!"</p>

"I did a photo-shoot with Light Photography in May, and I was very impressed with Sofia’s work. She always made me feel comfortable and was very knowledgeable about the ideal lighting and positioning for the pictures. Sofia was always charismatic and had a smile on her face. What I liked most about her service was her ability to make the pictures look very natural and spontaneous! I really loved the results! Thank you so much for everything."</p>

"We’ve been searching for a local photographer who can produce quality photographs that capture memorable moments, and Sofia’s it. Since photographing a couple of our personal events, we’ve hired her for numerous corporate parties and we’d definitely recommend Sofia for anyone looking to have a well-photographed event. Not only does she produce quality and stunning photographs, but her mannerism and professionalism pre, during, and post the event is outstanding. She’s able to produce photos in days, and sometimes, hours, after the event. Overall, it’s great working with her. Highly recommended!"</p>
