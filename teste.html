<h2>Hana Marku - July 3rd 2016</h2>
<p>"Sofia was friendly, professional and very easy to work with during our wedding - she helped us get the right balance of posed and natural photos and even stayed a bit longer to make sure no one was excluded from the photo-taking. She posted an initial batch of photos the next day and got us the full album (over 500 photos) within one week of our wedding. We have many beautiful images for our family to enjoy. Would definitely hire Sofia again!"</p>

"We have ve been searching for a local photographer who can produce quality photographs that capture memorable moments, and Sofia is it. Since photographing a couple of our personal events, we have hired her for numerous corporate parties and we would definitely recommend Sofia for anyone looking to have a well-photographed event. Not only does she produce quality and stunning photographs, but her mannerism and professionalism pre, during, and post the event is outstanding. She is able to produce photos in days, and sometimes, hours, after the event. Overall, it is great working with her. Highly recommended!"</p>
